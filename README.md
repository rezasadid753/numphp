# 🧮 NumPHP – Numerical Analysis Tools in PHP

A fun, practical toolkit for exploring **numerical methods**—built with pure PHP for students, learners, and tinkerers.

## 🚀 About

NumPHP was born during my third semester in university, when I was diving deep into numerical analysis. While most of my peers stuck with Python or MATLAB, I took a different route — building the entire toolkit in **PHP** to keep things web-native and accessible.

From root-finding to integration, this project brings theory to life with clean iterations and visual outputs — perfect for students who want to **see** what’s happening behind the formulas.

## 🔧 Features

- 📉 Step-by-step **iteration output** for better understanding  
- 🔄 Classic methods like Bisection, Newton-Raphson, Secant, Jacobi  
- 📈 Integration tools like Trapezoid & Simpson’s Rule  
- 🧩 Modular structure — easy to extend and play with  
- 💡 Clean and interactive web-based interface (PHP + JS + CSS)

---

## 🛠️ Built With

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Backend:** PHP (no frameworks)

No Python or external engines — just good ol’ PHP and math!
